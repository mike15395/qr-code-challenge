## My process

Firstly I started with giving background color then adding div container that will hold qr-code image and text.

After that with help of figma file, font size and color was adjusted. Also the image size was corrected.

Then at last i used flexbox to entire div container so that is adjusted automatically with screen size.


### Built with

- simple HTML and CSS only

### What I learned

After completing this challenge, I learned about HTML and CSS basics like adding background colors,font size,font color and most important flexbox.

Using flexbox takes care of responsiveness as i don't have to write separate CSS for different screen sizes.It automatically gets adjusted as per screen size.This saves a lot of time.

### Continued development

I want to get more familiar with writing responsive designs like adding media queries. 
CSS looks simple but is hard when actually implementing it. So i want to practice more projects focusing on reponsiveness.
